              In this tutorial series, we will be learning about Postman and how
              to do API testing as well as API test automation using Postman.
            </p>
            <h2>What is Postman?</h2>
            <p>
              A lot of people think of Postman as just an API client that allows
              you to send HTTP requests. While that is possible and you can send
              REST, SOAP & GraphQL requests directly from Postman but Postman is
              not just limited to that, it is packed with a lot more features
              such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Creating automated tests for your APIs in Postman which you can
                integrate with CI/CD pipeline
              </li>
              <li>
                Creating API mocks to simplify the design and planning of your
                APIs
              </li>
              <li>
                Create beautiful API documentation with Postman that is
                automatically updated every time you update your API collections
              </li>
              <li>
                When working with lots of APIs, its important to know how your
                APIs are performing, Postman has a great monitoring system to
                review your responses and performance with each run
              </li>
              <li>
                And, last but not least, Postman allows you to publish APIs as
                well as consume APIs that are already built by others through
                Postman Workspace which is a great way to collaborate with
                others
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pre-requisite</h2>
            <p>
              The only pre-requisite for this series is having a basic
              familiarity with APIs. If you are not familiar with API basics,
              make sure to check out my API Basics tutorial series so that you
              understand what API is and how it works.
